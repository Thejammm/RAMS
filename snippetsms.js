===============================================
HOW TO ADD NEW SNIPPETS
===============================================

STRUCTURE: Each snippet must have this format:

{
  id: "unique-id",
  title: "Display Name",
  fields: {
    title: "Full Title",
    equipment: "Item 1\nItem 2\nItem 3",
    ppe: "PPE 1\nPPE 2\nPPE 3",
    method: "- Step 1\n- Step 2\n- Step 3",
    training: "Training 1; Training 2",
    risks: "Risk 1; Risk 2; Risk 3",
    associated: "Reference 1; Reference 2"
  }
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Use \n to separate equipment, ppe, and method items (newline)
- Use ; to separate training, risks, and associated items (semicolon)
- Start each method step with "- " (dash + space)
- Keep id unique (no spaces, use hyphens/underscores)
- All 7 fields must be present
- Add your snippet BEFORE the }]; on the previous line

AUTOMATIC FORMATTING:
The bold headers "TRAINING:" and "ASSOCIATED RISKS:" are NOT added here.
They are automatically inserted by scriptms.js when the snippet is displayed.

Location in scriptms.js:
- Line 993: contentHtml += '<div><b>TRAINING:</b></div>';
- Line 1008: contentHtml += '<div><b>ASSOCIATED RISKS:</b></div>';

Your training and risks data is automatically formatted into lists if it contains:
- Semicolons (;) - items separated by semicolons become bullets
- Newlines (\n) - items separated by newlines become bullets
- Neither - displays as plain text

So you ONLY need to provide the raw data using ; or \n separators.
The JavaScript handles all display formatting automatically!
