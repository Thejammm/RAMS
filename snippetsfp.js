Barriers and signage will be used to clearly define working areas and prevent unauthorised access. Regular inspections will be carried out to ensure that working areas are safe and compliant with site rules. 
      Working in close proximity to heavy machinery is inherently dangerous and will be managed through strict adherence to safety protocols, signalling, and the use of spotters where necessary, vehicular movement management and exclusion zones.` },

      content: `This rescue plan sets out the procedures to follow in the event of an emergency during groundworks or excavation operations, including ground collapse, entrapment, service strikes, or persons or plant falling into an excavation. Its purpose is to ensure a safe, coordinated response that protects workers and enables quick medical assistance.
All site personnel must be familiar with these procedures. In the event of an incident, the site manager or supervisor will take control, ensure the area is made safe, and contact the emergency services. The appointed person will meet the emergency responders at the site entrance and direct them to the incident. Operatives must not attempt any rescue that would put themselves or others at risk.
If a collapse or entrapment occurs, work must stop immediately, the area must be evacuated, and all plant and machinery in the vicinity shut down. No one should re-enter the excavation until its stability has been confirmed by a competent person. Where safe, first aid can be provided while waiting for emergency assistance, and all workers must be accounted for at the designated assembly point.
Only trained and authorised personnel may carry out a rescue, and the safety of rescuers will always take priority.` },
